## Task 
   Based on their credit card data (described by 17 attributes and customer ID), determine the optimal number of groups to divide bank customers. Make a clustering algorithm and      verify its performance using statistical and exploratory data analysis methods.

## Functionality
   Methods used:
      - Data preprocessing (Drop missing data, remove constant features. etc.)
      - Dimensionality reduction using PCA
      - K-Means (to determine optimal number of clusters)
      - Data visualization
