# Project 1 - Pacman AI : 

## Task 
   Implement pacman game that supports multiple pacman agents. Agents have to work togather to collect all the food in the maze.

 
# Project 2 - Clustering : 

## Task 
   Based on their credit card data (described by 17 attributes and customer ID), determine the optimal number of groups to divde bank customers. Make a clustering algorithm and verify its performance using statistical and exploratory data analysis methods.
## Functionality
   Methods used:
      - Data preprocessing (Drop missing data, remove constant features. etc.)
      - Dimensionality reduction using PCA
      - K-Means (to determine optimal number of clusters)
      - Data visualization
